In todayâ€™s world Digitalization plays key role in every aspect. Like 
Digitalization of business helps to improve the efficiency of its process, 
consistency, and quality. It can Integrate conventional records or files into a 
digitalized form, eliminating redundancies and shortening of communications 
chain and facilitate a better informational exchange, that the transmitting and 
receiving of the data through online is increased.This, development has raised 
concerns about privacy and security. The information should be secured from 
the unauthorised users and privacy should be maintained so that the access 
should be only available for the authorised users.One of the effective methods 
to maintain privacy and secure the information is authentication.  
Digital Multifactor authentication is the best way to improve security.It, is an 
electronic authentication method in which computer user is granted access to an 
application or a website only after successfully presenting two or more factors, 
or pieces of evidence.This paper in addition to reviewing some sophisticated 
and potential MFA sources, also briefly dwells on the different ways MFA is 
being integrated. In conclusion, this paper gives future research directions and 
open problems that stem from our observations.
